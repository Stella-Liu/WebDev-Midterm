			<h2>Review</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>THERE ARE SPOILERS ALL OVER THIS SITE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br> YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED</h3>
			<br>
			<p>At the start, we don't know anything about the game. The only thing is we walk the princess through the puzzle, learning about the mechanics on how to play the game. Princess Ida always finish the puzzle with the princess taking off her hat and turning it over and a star polygon floats up from the hat. After a few chapters, we meet the storyteller and start to learn more about the backstory of Princess Ida. Princess Ida left Monument Valley with the sacred geometry causing all who roams in Monument Valley to forget their true selves and forever walk the monuments. She returns a sacred geometry every chapter until all have been returned and everyone is set free from the punshiment. Along the way, we meet other characters who will either help or hinder the Princess from completely the puzzle (<a href="char/characters.html">Character Page</a>).</p>

			<!-- Last Paragraph -->
			<p>The game is a basic interactive tapping, swiping game. Each chapter contains puzzles that would boggle your mind. Or be very intuitive on how to solve it. The reason why I say it is mind boggling would be because the game incorporates optical illusions. What is a normal puzzle game becomes a bit confusing. Incorporating something that we are not use to seeing together but understand makes the game a bit exciting. What we see doesn't mean we know what it will do and how it will interact with its surrounding. But it is also a very calming and relaxing game because the game is not very difficult and each puzzle is a beautiful scene, along with the colors.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Reason to why I like the game:
				<ol>
					<li>Every scene looks so simple and pretty.</li>
					<li>The game is a 3D puzzle game.</li>
					<li>The simplicity of just tapping and swiping on the screen to make things move.</li>
					<li>Optical Illusion</li>
					<li>Transformation of a puzzle</li>
